          of personal information. The following outlines our privacy policy.

          Our website uses forms in which you give us contact information (such
          as your name, address, phone number, IP address and email address) so
          you can create an account, purchase our products and services, request
          information and request support help. As you use your account, we may
          also collect support requests and other related types of information
          that is specific to the management of your account, products and
          services with us.

          contacting you when needed (when there are updates for the products
          and services you have purchased from us), to respond to your support
          requests and to inform you about our new products and services. We

          We will never share your information without your permission or in
          ways other than as outlined in this policy. The only exceptions to
          this are when we are required by law, in the good faith belief that
          such action is necessary in order to comply with the law, or when we
          must comply with a legal process.

          When your order of our product or service is refunded (or your
          subscription for our product and service is canceled) all of your
          personal information is placed in "deactivated" status. However, you
          should know that deactivation of your account does not mean your
          personal information has been deleted. We will retain and use your
          personal information, if necessary, in order to resolve disputes,
          enforce our agreements and/or as required by laws or regulations. By
          creating an account with us, using our support services and/or
          purchasing our products and services, you acknowledge and agree to
          these terms of retention.
